      <p class="section_text">When & where do you meet?

	<p class="section_text">Where?: CCIU TCHS Brandywine Campus, 443 Boot Road, Downingtown PA. We have a metal/wood shop and field set-up area in our warehouse space and a full robotics classroom supplied by Chester County Intermediate Unit (CCIU) Technical College High School Brandywine Campus. We share the building with our 7th grade thru high school FTC Team 7314. Check out our Calendar for specific meeting times. Generally, we meet every Wednesday of "Off Season" April-December (plus a few Saturday competitions) and virtually every day during "Build Season" January-February. March-April is competition season (2 or 3-day events, Thursday-Sunday), so meetings vary somewhere between Off Season and Build Season. We meet at other times as needed--or as we want to! We have an annual pool party, Pancake Breakfast, and other fun, not-necessarily-robotics events.</p>

	<p class="section_text">My Commitment?: Student: This is entirely your choice. Family, school, work, etc always come first - we'd love too see you when you're available. What you put in determines what you get out, so for students we recommend at least bi- or tri-weekly in the fall (summer entirely optional) and approximately 8 hours/week average during Build Season (2 weeknights or 1 weekend). This can be lower or concentrated in just a few weeks if you're interested in limited, specific field: disciplines like welding, electrical, scouting, spirit, and media have concentrated periods of higher activity (though some require certification training, and the teams are active throughout). All our student leaders commit 15-20hrs/week (and we love it!)</p>

	<p class="section_text">My Commitment?: Mentor: This is entirely your choice. Family, school, work, etc always come first - we'd love too see you when you're available. All we ask is that you explain your commitment upfront. We have limited-involvement roles that might only take a few hours a year (e.g. reviewing student work in your field of expertise, graphics, public speaking, etc). Non-lead, non-technical mentors might have few hundred hours/year (or more if you like) at various times. Overall technical mentors often commit bi-weekly during Off Season (April-Dec, summer optional) and 10+hr/week during Build Season (Jan-Feb). This ranges all the way up to full-time equivalent positions for top technical mentors. (Parents can also help in other ways!)</p>
