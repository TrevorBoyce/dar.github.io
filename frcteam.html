    <h1 class="title_text">About FRC Team 1640</h1>
      <p class="section_text">FRC Team 1640 was founded with 12 students in 2005 by Downingtown East High School physics teacher Paul Sabatino. Prior to joining the Downingtown East faculty, Mr. Sabatino mentored FRC Team 104 in the West Chester School District.</p>
	  <p class="section_text">The team's name is Sab-BOT-age, in honor of Paul Sabatino's vital contributions.</p>
	  <p class="section_text">In 2011, the team had to leave the aegis of the Downingtown Area School District and formed Downingtown Area Robotics, Inc. (DAR). The FRC 1640 team now encompasses thirty five students from throughout Chester County and more than a dozen mentors. While the organization has expanded its scope to include a FIRST Tech Challenge team and hosts two FIRST LEGO League events annually, FRC 1640 remains solidly the core of DAR.</p>
	  <p class="section_text">FRC 1640 competes within the FIRST Mid-Atlantic (previously Mid-Atlantic Robotics) District.</p>
      <h1 class="title_text">2017 Competition Season</h1>
     <p class="section_text">January 7th 2017, the team met at Hatboro-Horsham where this year's game, FIRST Steamworks, was revealed. Later, at the CCIU, the team went over the game rules and started designing this year's bot. We decided that our robot would use CVT Swerve, an innovative new drivetrain that garnered widespread recognition as the season went on. The next week, the team split into groups to focus on prototyping our robot subsystems. Then pivot parties were in full swing as we constructed our CVT Swerve modules. The days went on and our practice bot, Deux, came together. We continued to improve until the rush of the final days of build season to complete our competition bot, Prime. At midnight on February 21, 2017, Prime was bagged and in keeping with tradition, the team celebrated with Chinese food at the CCIU.</p>
<p class="section_text">During week one of competition, we scouted the Hatboro-Horsham event to prepare for Westtown, our first regional event. 1640 co-hosted this event with team 1931, The Metal Moose, the same team that would later lead our alliance with team 816 to a tiebreaker match in the semifinals. Ranked 18th in the qualifiers, 1640 won the Innovation in Control Award and junior student Meghana was nominated for the Dean’s List Award.</p>
<p class="section_text">Two weeks later at Seneca, 1640 was ranked 10th at the end of qualifications. We were picked by alliance captain 272, the Cyber Crusaders. Team 2729, Storm Robotics, completed our alliance. We lost in the semifinals, but 1640 had enough points to make it to MAR Championships. 1640 also had a huge, first-time win with the Engineering Inspiration award, which sent us to MAR Champs as one of six teams to compete for the award at the Championship level.</p>
<p class="section_text">In the run up to the highly competitive MAR Championship, we continued to improve our gear running, shooting, and climbing capabilities.  After two days and 120 qualification matches we ranked 34th at MAR Champs. Team 203 led our alliance with team 219 and we were knocked out in quarterfinals. Meghana advanced to become a Dean’s List finalist, and 1640 was awarded another Innovation in Control Award for CVT swerve.</p>
<p class="section_text">When it was revealed the team had enough points to make it to the world championship, all of the anticipation turned into excited and the team jumped all at once in celebration. The next weeks were hectic. The Houston Championship passed and we prepared to ship our robot and the team off to St Louis.</p>
<p class="section_text">In St. Louis, we played in the Archimedes division. Ranked 33rd in the division,  we were picked by the first seed alliance, team 1058. Also on our alliance was 67 and team 2137. Things were getting heated as our alliance made it through quarterfinals, semifinals, and then all the way to finals. We won our division in an incredible tie breaking game and just after the team was just beginning to settle down, the match was called for a replay and the stands were shocked. In the most intense moment of the season our alliance was forced to replay the match, but defeat was not an option and we won again bringing us all the way to Einstein (for the third time in the past five years!)
On Einstein, the Archimedes alliance played against some of the toughest teams in St Louis, including the legendary team 254, The Cheesy Poofs, where 1640’s defensive gear running strategy won the match.
After one exciting season, FRC team 1640 is winding down and we have attended two off-season competitions, MidKnight Mayhem and IRI.</p>
